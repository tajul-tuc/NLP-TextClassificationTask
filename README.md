### Here you will find two NLP model (One with DA methods and another one without DA methods) targeting the Disaster Tweets dataset (A Text Classification Problem)  
  
  

<br/>

# How can you run these NLP models

You can run a NLP model with or without DA by following Just two steps:

### Step 01 :
Download the dataset(TweetDataset) along with the pythong script (NLP Model) you want to run and then install some python libraries if they are not already installed in your machine.

```
Install Pandas (if you don't have it already):
Install matplotlib (if you don't have it already):
Install tensorflow (if you don't have it already):
Install seaborn (if you don't have it already):
Install NLTK (if you don't have it already):
Install textaugment (if you don't have it already): 
Install pickle (if you don't have it already): 
Install os (if you don't have it already): 
Install csv (if you don't have it already): 
Install re (if you don't have it already):  
```
### Step 02
Now it's time to run a NLP model using the machine terminal. You can follow the below commands to run your script using your machine terminal.

```
1. Run NLP-TextClassificationTask (From NLP Model Without DA Folder) ---> python3 NLP-TextClassificationTask.py

2. Run NLP-DA (From NLP Model With DA Folder) ---> python3 NLP-DA.py
