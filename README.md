# How can you run these NLP models?

You can run a NLP model with or without DA by following Just two steps:



### Step 01 
Download the dataset(TweetDataset) along with the python script (NLP Model) you want to run from NLP Model With DA / NLP Model Without DA folder and then install some python libraries if they are not already installed in your machine.

```
Install Pandas (if you don't have it already): pip3 install pandas
Install matplotlib (if you don't have it already): pip3 install matplotlib
Install tensorflow (if you don't have it already): pip3 install tensorflow
Install seaborn (if you don't have it already): pip3 install seaborn
Install NLTK (if you don't have it already): pip3 install NLTK
Install textaugment (if you don't have it already): pip3 install textaugment
Install pickle (if you don't have it already): pip3 install pickle
Install os (if you don't have it already): pip3 install os
Install csv (if you don't have it already): pip3 install csv
Install re (if you don't have it already):  pip3 install re
```

If you want learn more about these libraries or you have any problem to install you can go through the below link :

### Step 02
Now it's time to run a NLP model using the machine terminal. You can follow the below commands to run your script using your machine terminal.

```
1. Run NLP-TextClassificationTask (From NLP Model Without DA Folder) ---> python3 NLP-TextClassificationTask.py

2. Run NLP-DA (From NLP Model With DA Folder) ---> python3 NLP-DA.py
```
