## **NLP Model with Data Augmentation Methods For Disaster Tweets Dataset**  
  



### This is a simple nlp model with data augmentation methods (EDA) targeting Disaster Tweets dataset but you can use this model for any text classification task.

# How can you run this model step by step guide

You can run this model by following these steps:

### Step 01 :

Make sure python in installed in your machine (We checked until 3.8)

```
pip install python
```

### Step 02 :

Now we need to install some python library. If these libaries are already installed in your machine you can skip these step.

```
Install Pandas (if you don't have it already):
Install matplotlib (if you don't have it already):
Install tensorflow (if you don't have it already):
Install seaborn (if you don't have it already):
Install NLTK (if you don't have it already):
Install textaugment (if you don't have it already): 
Install pickle (if you don't have it already): 
Install os (if you don't have it already): 
Install csv (if you don't have it already): 
Install re (if you don't have it already):  
```
### Step 03 :

Now download the dataset and also the nlp_da.py file from this project and keep them in a same folder. 

```
data_train = pd.read_csv("train.csv")
```
This line need to change based on your folder path.


Finally to run the python script open your machine terminal and write down the following command

```
python3 nlp_da.py
```

That's it! We have successfully run a nlp model with data augmentation methods for solving a text classification task!
